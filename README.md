# Bots of Thrones

Winter is coming - and so are the bots.

## Usage

Create your own Game of Thrones inspired slackbot

  1. Fork, download, or install via npm.

  2. Generate a slack API token https://brisbane.slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations > bots

  3. Set `SLACK_API_TOKEN` as an environmental variable to whereever you will deploy to.

  4. Run `node index.js` or `git push heroku master`.  It even works from localhost!

  5. Invite `@bot_of_thrones` to your channel.


## Contributing

Writing a bot is easy - use the other bots (in `lib/bots`) as examples.


## Tests

When you play the game of thrones, you win or you throw an exception.  Yeah, I should probably add some eh?
